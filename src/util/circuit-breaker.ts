/**
 * @fileoverview Per-bucket circuit breaker for fetch retry storms.
 *
 * State machine per bucket key:
 *   closed -> open (after N consecutive failures)
 *   open -> half-open (after openMs cooldown)
 *   half-open + probe success -> closed
 *   half-open + probe failure -> open (cooldown refreshed)
 *
 * One probe at a time in the half-open window; concurrent acquire() during the
 * window returns undefined and the caller should fail fast by throwing
 * CircuitOpenError (exported from this module).
 *
 * CircuitOpenError extends ApiBaseError directly (NOT ApiServerError) - by
 * design. Many catches in the codebase narrow on `instanceof ApiServerError`
 * to fall back to offline behaviour (see src/api/chains/ton/auth.ts). A
 * breaker-open should propagate as a transient infrastructure error, not be
 * silently downgraded to "server returned an error".
 *
 * # Wiring contract (read before adding the first caller)
 *
 * acquire() is per logical call, NOT per retry attempt. The retry budget
 * belongs to the caller; the breaker counts one verdict per logical call.
 * Place acquire() OUTSIDE any retry loop and settle the slot exactly once
 * based on the final outcome.
 *
 * # Verdict semantics
 *
 * - recordSuccess()  - host responded with a usable answer (2xx, OR a deterministic
 *                      request verdict such as 400/404/422). Resets the failure
 *                      counter.
 * - recordFailure()  - host did not respond, or responded with an unusable
 *                      error (5xx, timeout, transport failure), or is shedding
 *                      load (429/408), or rejected authentication/access (401/403).
 *                      Counts toward the trip threshold.
 * - cancelled()      - caller bailed and has no information about host health
 *                      (AbortError from caller's signal, component unmount,
 *                      account switch). Releases the slot without verdicting.
 *
 * AbortError from the CALLER's signal is NOT a host-health signal - use
 * cancelled(), not recordSuccess() or recordFailure(). Deterministic request
 * errors are healthy verdicts, while 401/403/408/429 verdict as failures.
 *
 * # Canonical wiring pattern
 *
 *   const key = bucketKey(url);
 *   const slot = breaker.acquire(key);
 *   if (!slot) throw new CircuitOpenError(key);
 *   let settled = false;
 *   try {
 *     const response = await fetchWithRetry(url, init, options);
 *     slot.recordSuccess(); settled = true;
 *     return response;
 *   } catch (err) {
 *     if (isCallerAbort(err, init?.signal)) { slot.cancelled(); }
 *     else if (isRequestVerdict(err)) { slot.recordSuccess(); }  // e.g. 400/404/422
 *     else { slot.recordFailure(); }                              // 401/403/408/429/5xx/transport
 *     settled = true;
 *     throw err;
 *   } finally {
 *     if (!settled) slot.cancelled();                             // safety net
 *   }
 *
 * # Bucket key
 *
 * Use bucketKey(url) for shared-pool upstreams (toncenter - one bucket per
 * origin, since all endpoints share upstream rate-limit pools). Use
 * bucketKey(url, { includePathPrefix: true }) for our own backend
 * (per-endpoint SLA divergence - a slow /assets must not gate /currency-rates,
 * /swap, /referrer, etc.).
 *
 * # Known limitations
 *
 * - Slot leak: if a caller forgets to settle and bypasses the finally block
 *   (process crash, unhandled rejection), the probe slot stays held forever
 *   until reset(). No internal watchdog deadline.
 * - Bucket Map grows unbounded; reset() is the only eviction.
 * - now() defaults to Date.now which is non-monotonic; wall-clock jumps can
 *   skew the cooldown. Pass a monotonic clock if this matters.
 *
 * Pure in-process state. Each Worker/WebView instance has its own breakers;
 * this is not a cross-client coordination primitive.
 *
 * Peer artifact: src/util/fetch.ts (the sole intended production caller).
